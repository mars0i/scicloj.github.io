The first issues encountered led to a couple of revelations: Clojure is indeed cool, but data science relies heavily on FOSS libraries and tools that in Clojureland are all scattered around and usually poorly documented.\nScicloj is an umbrella for libraries, tutorials, ideas and open discussion trying to move further the idea that not only data science is possible with Clojure, but it can be a very nice experience as well (and it just works!).\nHow #\rScicloj tries to create broad discussions, where community members can reason together about their common goals.\nAt the same time, it maintains dedicated task groups that can have discussion around certain topics, such as: machine learning, wrapping useful data science libraries for use with Clojure, writing tutorials, organizing the community, editing the Scicloj website, and more.\nIn addition to textual, everyday discussions, Scicloj encourages meetings in small groups, as well as larger gatherings.\nWhere #\rContact details\n"}).add({id:1,href:"/docs/community/getting_involved/",title:"Getting Involved",description:"Would you like to join our journey in making Clojure a joyful platform for data science?\nBelow are some suggested ways to get involved.

If you are interested in any of these, or maybe have some other idea - then let us talk! We may possibly help in finding a nice way to begin.\nJoin our dev and study groups #\rScicloj is organizing a few dev groups and study groups that meet regularly to learn, to brainstorm, and to create. Your perspective could be helpful there.\nShare your experience #\rHearing about your personal workflow, data stories, problems and ideas can be valuable to others. Just open a new topic at one of the other relevant chat streams, and share your thoughts.\nWrite a tutorial #\rWriting tutorials (either small or big) about working with data is central to our process. The importance is twofold: sharing realistic experiences, and realizing what may be missing or could be improved in our stack. You may just pick an existing tutorial and translate it to Clojure. Or, you can pick some fresh new data and start analysing them from scratch.\nJoin the organizing team #\rAre you interested in the human aspects of growing the community? Or, do you want to be involved in the thought process about the goals and priorities of this community? Then the scicloj organizing team would welcome you to join. Even if your time is limited, contributing your thought can be important.\nPair with a library author #\rLibrary authors need users. Some of the actively developed libraries would benefit a lot from a user trying to use them and sharing their findings.\nHelp building the website and knowledge base #\rThe scicloj website would love to have more people involved in it. Contributing to the content organization, writing opinionated blog posts, helping with the aesthetics \u0026ndash; all would be welcome.\nCreate some proof of concept #\rDo you think that something is missing in our stack? Then let us maybe create it! Beginning with a small proof of concept, you can test the idea with other community members. If you suggest your idea, maybe someone will be happy to join you, and you create it together.\nContribute to a library #\rIs there any library that you are curious to learn about or just want to help building? Then a good way to learn may be to contribute. This may be some help in adding a feature, adding some tests, or writing documentation. You can offer that to the library author. Some would be happy and might offer a nice way to begin.\nSubmit an issue #\rHave you found a bug or a missing feature? Probably, the maintainers of actively developed libraries would be happy to know about it. Usually, the project Issues page or the project Zulip stream would be the place to do that. Most projects mention the preferred ways of communication in their README.\n"}).add({id:2,href:"/docs/community/groups/",title:"Study \u0026 dev groups",description:"coming soon",content:"coming soon\n"}).add({id:3,href:"/docs/community/chat/",title:"Chat streams",description:"The Clojurians Zulip #\rMost of our communication takes place in specific streams at the Clojurians Zulip chat.\nSmall task groups often create ad-hoc streams for their task, but a lot of the communitcation takes place in more popular, long-living streams (examples below).\nMost streams are public, some are private.

Usually, streams are chosen to be private not for secrecy, but for focus, and for creating an atmosphere where people are comfortable talking, knowing who are listening.\nThis original announcement of the Clojurians Zulip by Gert Goet gives some context and explains why it makes sense for some parts of the Clojure community to move into Zulip. Scicloj followed that advice.\nRelevant active streams #\rHere are the main scicloj-related active streams, dedicated to certain subgroups, child communities or sister communities of scicloj.\nGeneral discussion and Q\u0026amp;A #\r #data-science - general data science topics  Dev chat of specific tools and libraries #\r  #tech.ml.dataset.dev - discussing tech.ml.dataset\n  #scicloj.ml-dev - discussing scicloj.ml\n  #cljplot-dev - cljplot develompemt\n  #saite-dev - development of Saite and related projects such as Hanami\n  #pink-gorilla-dev - development of Pink Gorilla\n  #notespace-dev - notespace development\n  #libpython-clj-dev - libpython-clj development and usage\n  #libapl-clj-dev - libapl-clj development and usage\n  #clojisr-dev - clojisr development\n  #r-interop - R-interop development and usage: various libraries such as graalvm-interop and clojisr\n  Study groups / task groups #\r  #sci-fu - Scicloj foundations study group - learning together to build the Clojure data science ecosystem\n  #visual-tools - the stream of the visual-tools group, discussing collaborations around tooling for data visualization and literate programming\n  #wolfram-clojure-bridge - a stream for the monthly meetings around the Clojure bridge to the Wolfram Language.\n  #real-world-data - a stream for the real-world-data events, discussing uses of Clojure in real-world data projects\n  #scicloj-org - a private stream of the scicloj organizing team - for anybody interested in building the scicloj community and discssing its goals and priorities - let us talk if you wish to join.\n  #ml-study - machine learning and data analysis study sessions\n  #sicmutils - updates and discussions about sicmutils and its study group\n  #scicloj-tutorials - discussing community efforts for creating tutorials (a bit inactive as of 2022 Q1)\n  General streams worth knowing about: #\r  #announce - aggregation of announcements of other Clojure communication platforms (Clojureverse, Reddit /r/Clojure, etc.)\n  #beginners\n  #clojure - general Clojure discussions\n  #slack-archive - an archive of selected channels of the Clojurians Slack (if some channel you like is not there, you may ask the admins at the #zulip stream to add it)\n  #new-members - introductions of new Clojurians Zulip members\n  #zulip - discussing the Zulip platform, asking for technical help\n  Inactive streams of the past, that might be of interest #\r  #covid-19 - studying COVID-19 data (past hackathons and general discussions)\n  #nov21-workshops - a stream for the re:Clojure 2021 workshops\n  #dec21-data-science-special - a stream for the 2021 re:Clojure Data Science Special event\n  Recommended practices #\rYou may wish to learn a little bit about the concepts of Zulip streams and topics. Note that all streams and topics (and even single messages) have URLs, that you can open at separate tabs in your browser.\nWhen joining Zulip, it is a good idea to present yourself at the #new-members / hello topic, and in general, at topics called \u0026lsquo;hello\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;personal introductions\u0026rsquo; at specific streams you are subscribing to, mainly this \u0026lsquo;hello\u0026rsquo; topic at the #data-science stream.\nWhen reading the feed to cactch up, it is sometimes comfortable to browse through the aggregate feed of all streams, or at the feed of a specific stream, such as #data-science.\nWhen writing messages, it is recommended to be at the page of a specific topic, e.g. #data-science / tech.ml.dataset. That would prevent some very common mistake, of writing under the wrong topic.\nYou may wish to configure the streams-notifications behaviours to your taste.\nTo discover conversations relevant to you, you may browse and subscribe to streams. To see the feed of all public streams, including those you are not subscribed to, you can look at this URL (note that we are filtering out the huge #slack-archive stream).\n"}).add({id:4,href:"/docs/community/contact/",title:"Contact",description:" scicloj@gmail.com GitHub Zulip Chat streams  Main data science stream   Twitter Youtube  ",content:" scicloj@gmail.com GitHub Zulip Chat streams  Main data science stream   Twitter Youtube  "}).add({id:5,href:"/docs/community/",title:"Community",description:"Getting to know the Scicloj community",content:""}).add({id:6,href:"/docs/",title:"Docs",description:"Docs Doks.",content:""}),search.addEventListener('input',b,!0);function b(){var b,e;const d=5;b=this.value,e=a.search(b,{limit:d,enrich:!0});const c=new Map;for(const a of e.flatMap(a=>a.result)){if(c.has(a.doc.href))continue;c.set(a.doc.href,a.doc)}if(suggestions.innerHTML="",suggestions.classList.remove('d-none'),c.size===0&&b){const a=document.createElement('div');a.innerHTML=`No results for "<strong>${b}</strong>"`,a.classList.add("suggestion__no-results"),suggestions.appendChild(a);return}for(const[h,g]of c){const b=document.createElement('div');suggestions.appendChild(b);const a=document.createElement('a');a.href=h,b.appendChild(a);const e=document.createElement('span');e.textContent=g.title,e.classList.add("suggestion__title"),a.appendChild(e);const f=document.createElement('span');if(f.textContent=g.description,f.classList.add("suggestion__description"),a.appendChild(f),suggestions.appendChild(b),suggestions.childElementCount==d)break}}})()
